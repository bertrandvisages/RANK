  # Fix RLS policies for user_preferences table

  1. Changes
    - Drop existing RLS policies
    - Create new, more permissive policies for authenticated users
    - Ensure policies work with the test user UUID

  2. Security
    - Maintain basic security while allowing authenticated users to manage their data
    - Policies check for authenticated users but don't restrict by specific user_id
